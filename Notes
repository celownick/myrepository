Test Automation Integration into SDLC
(End-to-end stages from analysis to regression)
1. System Analysis and Test Planning
Understand System Architecture

Analyze components, interfaces, dependencies

Identify Testable Requirements

Functional and non-functional

Define Test Scope

What should be automated vs. manual

Select Automation Tools

Selenium, Cypress, Cucumber, REST Assured, etc.

Define Test Objectives and KPIs

Coverage goals, execution frequency, stability, maintainability

2. Requirement Gathering and Refinement
Collaborate with Stakeholders

Business analysts, product owners, developers

Define Acceptance Criteria

Use Gherkin (Given-When-Then) for BDD if applicable

Maintain Traceability

Map test cases to requirements (e.g., via Jira, Xray)

3. Test Case Design & Prioritization
Create Manual Test Scenarios First (If Needed)

Especially for critical paths

Convert to Automation Scripts

Modular, maintainable, reusable

Tag Tests by Type

smoke, regression, sanity, E2E, performance

Prioritize Based on Risk and Business Value

4. Automation Development
Follow Coding Standards

Naming, structure, DRY principles

Use Page Object Model / Screenplay Pattern

Parameterize Tests (Data-Driven Testing)

Version Control Integration

Place test code in Git alongside application repo (or dedicated repo)

Recommended: tests/ folder with same branching strategy as the app

5. Test Execution Strategy
Set Up CI/CD Pipelines

GitLab CI, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.

Define Trigger Conditions

On every commit, nightly builds, pull requests, or manually

Parallel Execution

Use containers, grids, cloud execution (e.g., Selenium Grid, BrowserStack)

6. Test Merge Strategy (Governance)
Isolated Feature Branches for Test Development

Follow Git Flow / Trunk-Based Development

Pull/Merge Request Reviews

Include test maintainers for reviews

Validation Before Merge

Run automated tests on feature branches

Tagging Strategy

Tag tests with @ready, @wip, @deprecated, etc.

7. Regression Suite Integration
Maintain a Stable Regression Pack

Only reliable and stable automated tests

Smoke Tests Run on Every Commit

Full Regression

Before release or major merges

Incremental Update

Automatically or manually include new stable tests

8. Reporting and Analysis
Generate Rich Reports

HTML (ExtentReports, Allure, Cucumber Reports)

Store Reports per Pipeline Run

Use GitLab Pages / S3 / Shared Drive

Send Automated Notifications

Email, Slack, Jira comments

9. Test Maintenance & Review
Regularly Review Flaky Tests

Quarantine if unstable

Refactor and Reuse Test Logic

Use shared libraries/utilities

Deprecate Obsolete Scenarios

Track Test Coverage

Code coverage + requirement coverage

10. Continuous Feedback Loop
Integrate with Development Feedback

Bugs -> Tests -> Fixes -> Rerun

Gather Metrics

Time to run, pass rate, flaky rate, coverage growth

Use Metrics to Drive Improvements
